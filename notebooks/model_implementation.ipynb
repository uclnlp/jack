    "# Implementing a new model with Jack \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we focus on the minimal steps required to implement a new model from scratch using Jack.\n",
    "Please note that this tutorial has a lot of detail. It is aimed at developers who want to understand the internals of Jack. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement a Jack Reader, we define three modules:\n",
    "- **Input Module**: Responsible for mapping `QASetting`s to numpy arrays assoicated with `TensorPort`s\n",
    "- **Model Module**: Defines the differentiable model architecture graph (_TensorFlow_ or _PyTorch_)\n",
    "- **Output Module**: Converting the network output to human-readable overall system output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jack is modular, in the sense that any particular input/model/output module can be exchanged with another one.\n",
    "To illustrate this, we will implement an entire reader, and will then go on to implement another reader, but reusing the _Input_ and _Output_ module of the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first reader will have a _Model Module_ based on *TensorFlow*, the second will have a _Model Module_ based on *PyTorch*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Overview\n",
    "As example, we will implement a simple Bi-LSTM baseline for extractive question answering, which involves extracting the answer to a question from a given text. On a high level, the architecture looks as follows:\n",
    "- Words of question and support are embedded using random embeddings (not trained)\n",
    "- Both word and question are encoded using a bi-directional LSTM\n",
    "- The question is summarized by a weighted token representation\n",
    "- A feedforward NN scores each of the support tokens to be the _start_ of the answer\n",
    "- A feedforward NN scores each of the support tokens to be the _end_ of the answer\n"

    "## Ports\n",
    "\n",
    "All communication between _Input_, _Model_ and _Output_ modules happens via `TensorPort`s (see `jack/core/tensorport.py`). Tensorports can be understood as placeholders for tensors, and define the ways in which information is communicated between the differentiable model architecture (_Model_ module), and the _Input_ and _Output_ modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when implementing new models: often there already exists a model for the same task, and you can re-use existing _Input_ or _Output_ modules. You can re-use existing modules by making sure that your new module is compatible to the  ports specified in the already existing modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you can reuse existing _Input_ or _Output_ modules, it is then enough to simply\n",
    "implement a new _Model_ Module (see below) that adheres to the same Tensorport interface.\n",
    "See `jack/readers/implementations.py` to see how different readers re-use the same modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a new port, however, it is also straight-forward to define one.\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will define most ports here."
